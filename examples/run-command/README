SUGARLISP RUN EXAMPLE

The sugar -r "run" option is meant as a convenient "compile-and-run" option that allows
you to work with .slisp files alone much as if sugarlisp were an interpreter. 

This (boring) example is really just a test that this sugar -r command works in all situations.

(i.e. with all permutations of ".slisp" and ".js" file types being "required" as modules)

To run it you simply do:

  sugar -r run.slisp

The different "require" scenarios can be tested by uncommenting some of the requires
in the .slisp files here, along with using "sugar <file>" to compile .js files
when needed.

RATIONALE

a. "sugar" alone is the way to compile .slisp files to .js files one at a time.
b. "sugar -r" is for running .slisp files directly without explicitly creating .js files.
c. "sugar -w" is for "watching" .slisp file changes and automatically compiling to .js files.

Note that b and c are really two different ways of thinking about how to use sugarlisp
on the server.

If you do "sugar -w" to generate .js files, you can simply run your main .js file with the 
node command.

Alternatively with "sugar -r" you might never create .js files and use the .slisp files
alone.
 
Note when using using "sugar -r", if you've omitted a module's file extension like e.g.:

    (require "subtract")

This will load "subtract.js" if it exists, even if it's older than "subtract.slisp".

If this concerns you, you can explicitly specify the file extension:

    (require "subtract.slisp")

This guarantees your latest "subtract.slisp" code is used, even if a "subtract.js" file exists.

You might likewise want to add *.js in your .gitignore file if you're a "sugar -r" kind of person.

Alternatively you might enjoy the flexibility using requires without the ".slisp" extension gives 
you to *deploy* just the generated .js files alone without the .slisp files.  In that case 
sugar -w can be used to ensure your generated .js files stay up to date with recently modified 
.slisp files.
