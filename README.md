# sugarlisp-core
SugarLisp Core is a simple lisp that all SugarLisp "dialects" build upon.

#### WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION

It's the responsibility of all SugarLisp language extension "dialects" to desugar their syntax into the s-expressions supported by SugarLisp Core.

This code grew from (and remains largely compatible with) [http://lispyscript.com](LispyScript)

(expect this readme to be greatly expanded soon!)
